# odin-admin-dashboard

This is a **faux admin dashboard** created as part of an assignment from The Odin Project.
It is designed to showcase previous projects completed before this with a layout inspired by admin dashboard designs.

## Key Features:

- **Sidebar Navigation**: Includes different sections such as Home, Profile, Settings, etc.
- **Project Cards**: Displays a portfolio of previous projects.
- **Announcements and Trending**: Sections to display announcements and trending subreddits, mimicking a dynamic content area.
- **Interactive Buttons**: Buttons for actions like New, Upload, and Share, but they are non-functional in this mockup.

## Technologies Used:

- **HTML**: Structure and content.
- **CSS**: Styling using custom variables, grid layout, and Flexbox for responsiveness.
- **Google Fonts**: Poppins font for a clean, modern design.
- **Tailwind Slate Color Palette**: Used to create the color scheme, giving the design a sleek and modern aesthetic with various shades of gray and blue.

## Purpose:

This project is not an actual working admin dashboard but is intended to display previous projects in an organized and visually appealing way, mimicking a typical portfolio page.
The goal is to practice HTML, CSS, and layout techniques like CSS Grid and Flexbox.
